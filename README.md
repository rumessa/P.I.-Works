Using Python 3.9.5


1. You will start from the top and move downwards to an adjacent number as in below.
2. You are only allowed to walk downwards and diagonally.
3. You can only walk over NON PRIME NUMBERS.
4. You have to reach at the end of the pyramid as much as possible.
5. You have to treat your input as pyramid.

For example:
      1
     8 4
    2 6 10
   8 5 9 10
   
The maximum path sum would be 1 > 4 > 10 > 10
